### Easy 1: Key Concepts of SQL Basics

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to store, query, and manage data in relational databases. 
Data is organized into tables (rows and columns). 
Each row is a record; each column is a field with a defined data type.

Core concepts:
- `CREATE TABLE` – define a table structure.
- `INSERT` – add records.
- `SELECT` – read data.
- `WHERE` – filter rows.
- `ORDER BY` – sort results.
- `UPDATE` – modify existing rows.
- `DELETE` – remove rows.
- Primary keys – uniquely identify each row.
- Foreign keys – link related data between tables.

These basics let us answer questions from data in a clear, consistent, and efficient way.
